## Abstract

Intraguild predation (IGP) is common in natural and human-managed systems and plays a critical role in food web dynamics. Although studies have documented the occurrence of IGP across a wide range of predator taxa, quantitative understanding regarding the degree/intensity of IGP remains lacking. I propose an experimental framework combining controlled feeding trials and stable isotope analysis to quantify the degree of IGP in an omnivorous food web in the field consisting of a top predator, a mesopredator, and a shared prey. The degree of IGP is defined as the proportion (in number) of mesopredators consumed in the total diet (shared prey + mesopredator) of top predators. Feeding trials along with stable isotope analysis are used to construct a standard curve of the relationship between the diet composition of top predator and its nitrogen isotope signatures. The nitrogen isotope signatures of field-collected top predator individuals are then analyzed and interpolated to the standard curve to estimate the degree of IGP in the field. The proposed framework leverages the strengths of different experimental approaches to study trophic interactions, providing a practical tool for quantifying IGP in a more accurate (controlled feeding trials and standard IGP curve) and realistic (stable isotope analysis of field samples) fashion. The current framework can be further extended to food webs involving more complex interactions (e.g., multiple shared prey) and complemented with other approaches (e.g., molecular gut content analysis) to capture a more complete picture of IGP dynamics in the field.
